# OffMyLawn
A project that allows you to say "git OffMyLawn" and shake your fist at the millennials - metaphorically. And, yes, I realize that I can't actually say 'git OffMyLawn' without a git command, but it's the thought here that counts. I want the world to know that I am a cranky old man with no time for these young whipper-snappers.

On the other hand. I can say 'git push OffMyLawn' - and that is a comforting thought. Kind of like I walk up to a youngster lounging insouciently on the corner of my lot and say "Git ..." give them a (gentle) push and say "... OffMyLawn". 

What does all this have to do with software development? Should I be planning to vote for Donald Drumpf - excuse me, Trump. Can I port my Basic Program from 1973 into some modern language like pascal? Will I ever get over the feeling of rejection that Linda Carey caused in 8th grade? And why do Python regular expressions give me indigestion?
